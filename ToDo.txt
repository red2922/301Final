THIS IS A MALICIOUS PROJECT. ONCE COMPLETED PLEASE DO NOT OPEN ON YOU PERSONAL MACHINE 
This is currently for a windows OS but I would like to change it to a Linux. This a majorly a test to see what we can learn from 
how a virus like this works. 

Need to pwd, then ls, then give commands to user

Implement a way to input any command by user. If command is wrong print out a message saying the command doesn't exist or even
just return the error message from the linux machine 

Also Create a Assembly program that will automatically force the computer to run the Infector.py script


To Do List:
-File must start automatically
-File must also restart itself when stopped
-Be able to put in any commands and have it successfully run 

Host.py looks good

Infected.py needs to be updated and changed. Lines 25 to end 

- Currently you are able to connect to each other but only when hard coded. Possibly find a way to completely change that and have 
it so whenever any laptop can run the code 

-Make way to send and recieve code. From windows to linux must be a way to run code (Converting stings to Binary/byte like Object)


What is done:
successfully created a socket server 
s.socket((Host,Port))

Found a way to send and revieve messages

Client Side: 
infected.send(message.encode())
infected.recv(Max Message size)

Infected Side:
(Sends to server)
s.send(cwd.encode())

Need to add a recv while loop in order to take in any command that comes in and then sends the output from the linux side


For every command sent there should be a way to recv (Hence the recv)
for every command that is send there should be a recv function called and displayed to the user. 

To Do: Infected
recv a command
run a command 
return the output of it
